- Batch processing audio files

## Project Overview

ComfyUI-HunyuanCustom-GGUF is a custom node extension for ComfyUI that enables the use of Hunyuan models in GGUF format, along with advanced audio processing capabilities. Here's a detailed overview of the project's functionality:

### Core Functionality

- **Custom Nodes for ComfyUI**:  
  The extension provides a set of custom nodes that integrate seamlessly with ComfyUI's workflow system. These nodes handle the loading and processing of Hunyuan models, audio files, and other inputs.

- **Hunyuan Model Integration**:  
  The project supports Hunyuan models in GGUF format, which are optimized for text, image, and audio generation. These models are loaded using custom nodes like `UnetLoaderGGUF`, `CLIPLoaderGGUF`, and others, ensuring efficient and flexible usage within ComfyUI.

- **Audio Processing**:  
  The extension includes advanced audio processing capabilities:
  - **Stem Separation**: Using UVR5 models, the extension can separate audio into vocals and instrumentals.
  - **Vocal Processing**: The VR architecture models enable echo removal, noise reduction, and reverb removal, enhancing the quality of audio outputs.
  - **Batch Processing**: Users can process multiple audio files simultaneously, with options to mix and weight the outputs.

### Workflow Integration

- **Workflow Management**:  
  Users can load predefined workflows from the `workflows` directory, which are designed to showcase the capabilities of the custom nodes. These workflows can be customized to suit specific needs.

- **CLI and Scripting**:  
  The project includes a command-line interface (`cli.py`) and batch processing scripts (`batch_process.py`, `process_batch.sh`), allowing users to automate and streamline their audio processing tasks.

### Technical Implementation

- **Modular Design**:  
  The project is structured as a Python package, with clear separation of concerns:
  - `nodes.py`: Defines the custom nodes for ComfyUI.
  - `audio_utils.py`: Provides utilities for audio file handling and processing.
  - `cli.py`: Implements the command-line interface for batch processing.
  - `__init__.py`: Exports the necessary classes and functions for easy integration.

- **Dependencies**:  
  The project relies on a set of Python libraries, including `torch`, `librosa`, `soundfile`, and others, which are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Usage

- **Installation**:  
  The extension is installed as a custom node in ComfyUI, with detailed instructions provided in the README.

- **Running Workflows**:  
  Users can start ComfyUI, load a workflow, configure settings, and run the workflow to generate outputs.

- **Batch Processing**:  
  The provided scripts allow users to process multiple audio files in batch mode, with options to customize the processing parameters.

### Conclusion

ComfyUI-HunyuanCustom-GGUF is a powerful and flexible extension that enhances ComfyUI's capabilities with advanced audio processing and model integration. It is designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible, making it a valuable tool for developers and users working with audio and model generation.

- `--de-noise`: Enable noise reduction
- `--de-reverb`: Enable reverb removal

## Models

### HunyuanCustom GGUF Models

The HunyuanCustom-GGUF models are available on Hugging Face:
[https://huggingface.co/YarvixPA/HunyuanCustom-gguf/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/YarvixPA/HunyuanCustom-gguf/tree/main)

**Available Quantizations:**
- `hunyuan_video_custom_720p-Q2_K.gguf` (4.8 GB) ‚Äì fastest, lower quality
- `hunyuan_video_custom_720p-Q3_K_M.gguf` (6.22 GB) ‚Äì good compromise
- `hunyuan_video_custom_720p-Q4_K_M.gguf` (7.86 GB) ‚Äì recommended
